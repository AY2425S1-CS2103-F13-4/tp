### Project: TalentConnect

**TalentConnect is designed for solo, freelance, or third-party recruiters who need to manage a large number of
candidates and job listings.** These users often work independently, seeking a tool that helps
them efficiently track candidate details and job requirements. While it has a GUI, most of the user
interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

Given below are my contributions to the project.
