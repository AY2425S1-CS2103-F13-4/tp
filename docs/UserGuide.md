   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list contact` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add contact n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com r/Software Engineer` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

   * `delete contact 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add contact n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add contact n/John Doe`.

* Commands, not including their parameters, are case-insensitive.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `adD CONTact`, it will be interpreted as `add contact`. 

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [s/SKILLS]` can be used as `n/John Doe s/Python` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[s/SKILLS]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `s/Python`, `s/Python s/Cuda` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE`, `p/PHONE n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous TalentConnect home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
